When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would rather have a remote repository, when I might have to work from different locations and still have access to all my files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It's better that I pull my changes manually becuase then I have a control over what exactly I want to store on my local directory instead of having everyting. Also, it helps if someone else is working on the same project, I may not want it in my directory.
